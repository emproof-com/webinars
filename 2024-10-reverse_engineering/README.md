# Reverse Engineering – How Attackers Uncover Secrets in Binaries

In our webinar "Reverse Engineering: How Attackers Uncover Secrets in Binaries" we will introduce the foundational concepts of reverse engineering from an attacker’s perspective. Reverse engineering is a crucial technique used by attackers to understand and manipulate software, turning low-level code into meaningful information. Participants will learn how reverse engineering is applied to extract secrets from binaries, pirate software, and identify bugs.

The webinar will cover the following topics:

* Introduction to Reverse Engineering: What it is and why it’s a powerful tool for attackers.

* Motivation and Use Cases: Exploring reasons behind reverse engineering, such as secret extraction, piracy concerns, and bug discovery.

* From Binary to High-Level Code: A step-by-step guide from machine code to human-readable code.

* Key Tools for Reverse Engineering: An overview of disassemblers and decompilers, with a focus on Ghidra.

* Live Demonstration: A practical showcase of reverse engineering in action, with a focus on learning how to interpret code and extract hidden information.

Designed for a partially technical audience with some programming experience but no prior knowledge of low-level languages, this session will provide insights into how attackers approach binary software. By understanding these techniques, attendees can develop a deeper awareness of the threats posed by reverse engineering and learn how to protect their systems.

The webinar is aimed at raising awareness of the risks associated with reverse engineering and equipping attendees with practical knowledge they can use to analyze and defend against such attacks.
