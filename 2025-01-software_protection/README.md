# Software Protection -- Safeguarding Code Against Reverse Engineering

In our webinar "Software Protection: Safeguarding Code Against Reverse Engineering", we will explore the essential techniques used to defend software against reverse engineering, piracy, and tampering. Software protection is a vital aspect of securing code in today's evolving threat landscape, combining passive and active measures to increase resilience against attacks. Participants will learn how software protection mechanisms work, their practical applications, and the value they bring to software security.

The webinar will cover the following topics:

* Threats of Reverse Engineering (Recap): A quick overview of how reverse engineering is leveraged by attackers to uncover software secrets.

* Introduction to Software Protection: Understanding the concept, purpose, and overarching goals of software protection.

* Passive Protections: Techniques such as code obfuscation, with practical examples like control-flow flattening and arithmetic obfuscation.

* Active Protections: Strategies including packing, anti-debugging, anti-emulation, and anti-tampering mechanisms.

* How Protections Work: Insights into the underlying mechanics and effectiveness of these techniques.

Designed for a technical audience with some programming experience but limited or no background in security, this session will provide a foundational understanding of software protection. By the end of the webinar, attendees will have gained practical insights into how these protections operate, the challenges they address, and the benefits they offer for safeguarding software systems.

This webinar is ideal for those seeking to enhance their awareness of software protection and learn actionable strategies to defend against reverse engineering attacks.
