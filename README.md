# Emproof Webinars

This repository hosts materials for the Emproof webinar series, focusing on topics related to binary security. These webinars cover a range of subjects including reverse engineering, binary analysis, and embedded security, with the goal of making complex security concepts more accessible. The series is designed for a technical audience with little to no background in security and aims to increase awareness and understanding of various threats and protective measures in the world of firmware and hardware security.

Visit [Emproof](http://emproof.com) for more information. The webinar series is organized by [Tim Blazytko](https://github.com/mrphrazer/). For questions or more information, feel free to reach out via the [Emproof contact form](https://www.emproof.com/contact/).
