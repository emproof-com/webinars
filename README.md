# Emproof Webinars

This repository hosts materials for the Emproof webinar series, focusing on topics related to binary security. These webinars cover a range of subjects including reverse engineering, binary analysis, and embedded security, with the goal of making complex security concepts more accessible. The series is designed for a technical audience with little to no background in security and aims to increase awareness and understanding of various threats and protective measures in the world of firmware and hardware security.
