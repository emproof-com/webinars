# Secrets Unveiled -- What Attackers Find in Embedded Systems

In this joint webinar by Emproof and Swissbit, "Secrets Unveiled: What Attackers Find in Embedded Systems", we will explore the critical risks associated with embedded systems, including both embedded Linux and bare-metal firmware, from a security perspective. Embedded systems are integral to modern technology, but they often harbor sensitive information that attackers can exploit. This session will raise awareness of the types of data attackers can extract and demonstrate how to safeguard your systems against such threats.

The webinar will cover the following topics:

* Embedded Linux Exposures: Learn how password files, source code, user profiles, configuration files, credentials, certificates, cryptographic keys, and more can be uncovered.

* Firmware Secrets: Understand how attackers extract user credentials, hardcoded passwords, internal IPs/domains, secret algorithms, and intellectual property from binary firmware.

* Protection Strategies: Discover practical defenses, including encryption, authentication (e.g., Swissbit solutions), firmware obfuscation, and data encryption (e.g., solutions from Emproof).

* Live Demonstration: See real-world examples of how sensitive information is extracted and protected in embedded systems.


Designed for a technical audience with limited or no prior background in security, this webinar aims to build awareness of the hidden risks in embedded systems and provide actionable insights to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Join us to learn how to stay ahead of attackers and protect your systems.
